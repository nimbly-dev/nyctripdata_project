This project simulates a **production-grade Data Infrastructure** designed to process NYC trip data through multiple stages: **dev**, **stage**, and **production**. The pipeline handles **millions of trip data records**, ensuring reliability and scalability through techniques like **batch writing** and **disk spill management**.

### 📊 Dataset
The data is sourced from the [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Many data engineering principles used in this project are inspired by the [DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp).

### 🛠️ Data Architecture
The project leverages both **Data Lakehouse** and **Data Warehouse** concepts to ensure efficient data management:
- **Data Lakehouse**: Local storage is organized under the `spark-lakehouse` directory, where temporary files, downloads, and processed trip data are stored.
- **Data Warehouse**: The data workflow transitions data across **dev**, **stage**, and **production** PostgreSQL databases, ensuring a smooth lifecycle management process.

This pipeline demonstrates the capability to handle large datasets with high reliability and efficiency in a production-like environment.
